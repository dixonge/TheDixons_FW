Most of the story relies on a single quote from Albert Cook Myers, in his seminal work \"Immigration of the Irish Quakers into Pennsylvania 1682-1750\" which was published in 1902. In it, Mr. Myers refers to a wedding listed in the Lurgan Monthly Meeting in Co. Armagh, Ireland. A William Dixson married Isabelle Rea. In attendance were both a Henry and a Rose Dixson. Myers then states the following:</p>\n<blockquote>This, no doubt, is the same family that came over to New Castle Co., prior to 1690. Henry Dixson, it is said, kept an inn at New Castle</blockquote>\n<p>This statement is not supported by any source at all. \"no doubt\" and \"it is said\" is extremely shaky proof, especially since Myers was publishing this information over <em>two-hundred years</em> after the fact!</p>\n<p>And yet, like many things in the genealogy world, it was generally accepted. Since the 1990's, when genealogy began finding its way online, this story has been copied and pasted until it seems like plain fact.</p>\n<p>One other source of information comes from the hand of Thomas Pierson, William Dixon's eventual brother-in-law. Thomas was eventually the Deputy Surveyor of Penn's Colony, and his second wife was William's sister, Rose Dixon. At some point some journal notes from Thomas Pierson surfaced where he indicates he sailed from England (southeast coast) to Marlyand \"in company with Wm Dixon.\"</p>\n<p>From this statement, many early writers assumed that this was the same William from Lurgan <em>and</em> the same William who was later his brother-in-law. But both of these are assumptions! </p>\n<p>So far, the main sources that are missing are the following:</p>\n<ol><li><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Henry Dixon's burial location, in either Ireland or Pennsylvania</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Rose Dixon's burial location, in either Ireland or Pennsylvania</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Birth records for William, Dinah and/or Rose (the sibling)</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Quaker church records for 'removal' from Lurgan for any of the siblings</span></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Quaker church records for 'arrival' from Lurgan to one of the Pennsylvania meetings</span></li></ol>\n<p>Keep in mind that there <em>are</em> removal records showing Thomas Pierson's various trips across the Atlantic. The lack of similar records for any of the Dixon siblings is problematic.</p>\n<p>It <em>would</em> be rather coincidental for Thomas Pierson to sail with a William Dixon and then end up marrying a sister of a William Dixon just to have both of these Williams be different, unrelated people. But if these Dixons were from the Bristol, England area, where Thomas originated, that would resolve some of the coincidence.</p>\n<p>I have been looking into the origins of the sibling spouses to see if there might be a pattern. So far, the only pattern is that the spouses were Quaker. William's spouse Ann Gregg was from a different county in Ireland. Rose's spouse was Thomas Pierson from Bristol, England. Dinah's spouse Michael Harlan was from Lurgan and his brother Thomas witnessed the marriage of William Dixon and Isabelle Rea. </p>\n<p>Now <em>that</em> is also an interesting coincidence, but does not prove prior knowledge or connections from Lurgan.</p>\n<p>However, if you continue searching a bit you do find additional ties. Valentine Hollingsworth was once tasked by the Lurgan meeting to speak with Henry Dixon for 'walking disorderly.' (this did not refer to drunkenness, but rather doing things outside the Quaker principles) He later was a founder of the Newark Monthly Meeting in what is now northern Delaware. In this meeting both Rose and Dinah Dixon met, were approved for and married their spouses. The fact that the Hollingsworth and Harlan families continued their ties from Lurgan to Newark weighs in favor of the Dixon siblings also having some form of connection to Lurgan as well. The exact genealogical connection still remains unproven, however.</p>\n<p>Various Dixon researchers over the years have wrestled with this problem. E. O. Dixon, in 1996, visited Ireland and dug into the records. He proved William and Isabell were older than the immigrant William and still active in Lurgan long after the Dixon siblings showed up in Delaware. This leaves the Dixon siblings <em>completely absent</em> from the Lurgan meeting records. Indeed, absent from any known Quaker meeting records in Ireland!</p>","G":1662809955548,"H":"2dC*[2uX!"},{"C":"~_oNpoZ}Z","A":"Dixon Mills Across America","D":"dixon_mills_across_america","E":1662809981714,"F":"<p><img src=\"images/tick-creek.png\"><i>C<span style=\"font-family: BlinkMacSystemFont, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">ropped map of the Tick Creek area in Chatham County, North Carolina</span></i><br></p>\n<p></p><hr>\nRevised July 1, 2018\n<p>The Dixons seemed to have one thing in common: every couple of generations they got the urge to explore, to move to the frontier and stake their claim on uninhabited land. <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-357\">William Dixon</a>'s&nbsp;parents or grandparents certainly did so, most likely as part of King James’ Plantation of Ireland. William and his sisters took the BIG leap and left for Penn’s Colony in the New World in 1689, even as William of Orange was landing in northeast Ireland with a large force that would eventually push King James’ Jacobite forces almost into the Atlantic! In the mid-1700’s William Dixon’s descendants moved to North Carolina and western Pennsylvania. In the early 1800’s they moved on again to Ohio just a few years after the NorthWest Territories were opened to settlers.</p>\n<p>One byproduct of all this moving and exploring was that they were almost always on the outer edges of the normal channels of commerce. Thus, they were farmers. And one thing farmers both produce and consume in large quantites is grain! So it’s no surprise that wherever the Dixons roamed they built and operated mills.</p><p><br></p>\n<h2>Delaware Mill on Dixon's Run</h2>\n<p>William Dixon lived in the Christiana Hundred section of far northern Delaware. The northern border was -- well, there *was* no northern border, per se, as this area was still part of Penn's Colony, generally referred to as 'the lower counties.\" Christiana Creek, Brandywine Creek and Red Clay Creek were the other boundaries. His descendants built a mill somewhere south of Centerville, Delaware, on what became known as Dixon’s Run. As of 1888 it was still standing and although a “very aged structure” it was still in use by the Edwin Griffith estate.</p><p><br></p>\n\n<h2>Dixon's Mill - Cane Creek, North Carolina</h2>\n<p>William's grandson Simon Dixon bought land in North Carolina (from the ‘Lords Proprietors’) in 1751. He erected Dixon’s Mill on Cane Creek for corn and/or grain grinding. It was burned and rebuilt many times but always used that creek for water power. In 1925 a millstone from his mill was used as his commemorative gravestone as part of a monument erected by the Alamance County Historical Society. In 1953 a fire destroyed the remaining house and mill and it was purchased by a wealthy citizen of Durham who purportedly disassembled it down to the ground in a search for hidden gold.</span><br></p><p><img src=\"images/simon-dixon-mill.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"font-family: BlinkMacSystemFont, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"><i>Simon Dixon Mill on Cane Creek -- Chatham County, North Carolina</i></span><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Jesse Dixon Mill - Napton, North Carolina</h2>\n<p>In my direct line another of William’s grandsons, <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1123\">Joseph Dixon</a>, moved south of the Cane Creek area in 1764, three miles south of present-day Siler City. While most of his siblings had moved to what was then Fayette County in western Pennsylvania, he and many other Dixons (Samuel, Nathan, Caleb, Joshua) bought land up and down Tick Creek/Tick Ridge in North Carolina for several miles. The Napton Monthly Meeting and burial ground was in the ‘middle’ of this property. One of these Dixons (Joseph' son, <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1124\">Jesse Dixon</a>) built a saw and grist mill on eleven acres near the Rocky River (see map above) which operated until 1879, but had fallen into ruin by the time descendant Ben F. Dixon visited in 1934. Nearby, on the same Dixon tract, was an Old Tory Fort dating to the Revolution. As of 1934 it belonged to the estate of John J.

Caleb’s three sons Daniel, George and Jonathan moved to Ross County, Liberty Township. Daniel built a mill on the Scioto River and it was still grinding in 1934. Three years later, in 1803 three more Dixons moved to the area – Joseph’s sons <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1124\">Jesse Dixon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1106\">Samuel Dixon&nbsp;</a>(my direct ancestor), and <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1125\">Joseph Dixon</a>. Joseph built a saw and grist mill on Salt Creek which feeds the Scioto River. To this day if you look at a map of Londonderry, Ohio in southeast Ross County you will find, just to the east of town, along a portion of the Salt Creek — Dixon Mill Road. And it is on that road that I found the remains of the old mill. Here are some photos I took in 2011.

It was built as an addition to the saw mill and grist mill, erected a few years previously and owned by Samuel B. Burt. James Keyes wrote in his Pioneers of Scioto County:<br><blockquote>\"Mr. Burt, being in possession of a good water power, and Frank Valodin, Jr., his son-in-law, having plenty of ready cash, formed a partnership and built the forge for the production of bar iron drawn out and refined under the heavy blows of a trip hammer.\"</blockquote>These forges furnished the blacksmiths of that time with their main supply of iron for various purposes. The dam for power at the mills and forge was placed on the stream where the floor is sandstone and the west bank a cliff of the same material. The stone thus provided substantial foundation for both the dam and the mills and for a ford on the road that led past the works.<br>The forge was built in 1826 and continued to run successfully for several years. The crude pig metal for refining came from Franklin and Scioto furnaces, the former ten, and the latter seven miles distant. A part of the product was used locally, a part hauled eastward to the furnaces in the Hanging Rock Iron Region, and a part wagoned to the Ohio River at Sciotoville, a distance of three miles, and shipped to down-river points by flat boats. It was managed by Mr. Wurtz and had three refinery or knobbling fires, one puddling furnace, and one hammer. Through misfortune of some cause or other the proprietors eventually ran into debt and broke up. The mills and forge then passed to the control of Duncan McArthur and others, under the name of Lafayette instead of Scioto. About this time the Purdy family came from the East to operate the forge. The refining of iron continued here until after 1853 when this method gave way to the more progressive steps of the rolling mill. The flour mill and saw mill passed successively to Joseph Smith, Silas Dixon in 1850, and then to George and Noah Dixon in 1866. The mills continued to operate until 1912, the last few years under the care of Noah Dixon's sons.</blockquote><blockquote><span style=\"font-family: BlinkMacSystemFont, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">\"Early Iron Enterprises,\" loc. cit.; James Keyes, Pioneers of Scioto County (Portsmouth, Ohio, 1880), 37; George N.

I am <strong>so</strong> thankful that my mother started interviewing relatives and taking notes when I was just a child. Most of the people she talked to are now dead and gone, bits and pieces of their memories preserved in her notebook. It was her initial investigation that enabled us to contact a distant cousin who was able to connect us to the rest of the family tree going back to 1633. Over the last several years I have been filling in the blanks and connecting the dots, but as most genealogists know for every piece of information you find you usually discover the existence of several other pieces of information which are out of your reach. As an example, I recently connected with a long lost cousin through <a href=\"https://www.familytreedna.com/groups/dixon-project/about\">DNA testing</a>. Once this was established we began looking for connections from the Dixon Quakers of North Carolina to this person’s oldest known ancestor who died in 1801 in Georgia. In the process I discovered where yet one more branch of Dixons had disappeared to and found several new monthly meetings where Dixons had attended. One such meeting was the Lost Creek MM in eastern Tennessee. I also ran across a book written about this meeting entitled “Lost Creek Memories” by none other than Ben F. Dixon, the author of two major resources for our Dixon line. As it turns out he has authored over 20 books on history, mainly Quaker-related. So now there are an additional 20+ books that I know about but have no way to read as they are mostly out-of-print and are probably collecting dust on a few library shelves.<br></p>\n<p>Now, on top of all that which genealogists have been dealing with for years, no doubt, comes the internet. There are many web pages which I consider to be vital resources. I read them again and again finding new clues. But what if those pages were suddenly gone?</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/fading-teaser.jpg\"><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>What if the hosting account ended, or the owners passed away? Do I have copies of the information somewhere? And even if <strong>I</strong> have a copy, what about all the other people who might need that information? Thus, I have decided that I need to copy all of these sites <strong>and</strong> republish them on my web site. Normally this would be considered some sort of copyright infringement but when you run across a web site with vital, unique family information and it hasn’t been updated since 1998 you should be scared! So now I have another project.</p>\n<p>You can look for these pages here (at some point).

In this analogy a genealogical foundation would be one’s oldest ancestor.</p>\n<p>But from a <em>research</em> perspective, the analogy is backwards. You start with who you know (yourself, your parents, your grandparents) and work your way from the recent generations back to the oldest generations. The foundation of your research is the here and now and the recent past. Your ancient ancestors are discovered last, not first, so you can’t start with them.</p>\n<p>Taking all of this into account I’ve decided that the foundation of my genealogy research is the grandparents of myself and my wife (since she isn’t as interested in genealogy and history as I am). That is eight people, eight surnames, eight family lines. Half paternal, half maternal.</p>\n<p>And for the sake of the 52 Ancestors in 52 Weeks challenge, it’s a good place to start.</p>\n<h3>DIXON</h3><p>The foundation of this line is my paternal grandfather Harold Dixon. Born in Illinois in 1907, his family moved to Southeast Iowa when he was 13. He married in 1928 and they had their first child three months later! His career was in carpentry, and I learned to play pool in his basement. He is long gone, and I am now 60-something, and every morning, just like he did, I am up before dawn, sitting alone, drinking coffee.</p>\n<p>This line is the one I am most familiar with, stretching back to some of the original Quakers in Ireland. The first Dixons arrived in the Colonies in 1688/9 in southern Penn’s Colony, in what is now northern Delaware.</p>\n<h3>STANLEY</h3><p>My paternal grandmother Flossie Stanley, born in 1905. The matriarch of the family, maker of butterhorns (a cherished recipe), source of the bottomless cookie jar. She was the glue, the social center for my extended family who mostly stayed in Burlington, Iowa. Need to find who her grandparents were.</p>\n<h3>PETERSON</h3><p>My maternal grandfather David Peterson. He was born in South Carolina in 1910 and lived his life in the vicinity of King’s Mountain, North Carolina. He was an alcoholic and an abuser, yet in spite of that my mother still saw the good in him. His life was never easy and it was often due to his own hand. His father, James Robert Peterson, has very conflicting stories surrounding his father. He was either a McDaniel (per oral tradition) or a Peterson, per his death certificate. His mother was also a Peterson, sister to the Peterson on the death certificate…</p>\n<h3>ELLIS</h3><p>My maternal grandmother Lorena Ellis. She was born in North Carolina in 1905 and never left Cleveland County. She tried her best to protect her five children from her husband and eventually left once they were grown. Her life was never easy, ever. Cotton defined her life. She and her children were sharecroppers, and later she found steadier work in the cotton mill. Her grandfather, Zenas Alonzo Ellis, was the last in this Ellis family to hold slaves. On her mother’s side of the family, the Allens, her great-grandmother was a Camp. This line goes back to at least 1480 in England, with the family name being present there as far back as 1300.</p>\n<h3>REES</h3><p>My wife’s paternal grandfather, Robert Rees, was born in Ohio in 1888 and died in 1939. He was the son of a Welsh immigrant, David.</p>\n<h3>WORMER</h3><p>My wife’s paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Wormer, was born in Ohio in 1883 and died nine days short of her 100th birthday. Her parents were from Europe. Her mother was born on the French side of the Rhine, her father on the German side.</p>\n<h3>GILMORE</h3><p>My wife’s maternal grandfather, Jesse Gilmore, was born in Texas in 1895 and lived there until his death in 1977. He worked for the Aquilla sanitation department. This Gilmore line appears to go back to colonial times, immigrating from Ireland or Scotland in the early 1700’s.</p>\n<h3>SCRUGGS</h3><p>My wife’s maternal grandmother, Clemmie Scruggs, was born in Texas in 1898 and lived there until she died in 1962. Her grandmother was a Camp, sharing a common ancestor with my Grandmother Ellis’ Camp line. Wife and I are 7th Cousins once removed.</p>","H":"2dC*[2uX!","G":1662813971736},{"C":"^zyT\\V,m@","A":"Favorite Find","D":"favorite_find","E":1662814148601,"F":"<p>52 Ancestors in 52 Weeks - Week 2</p><p><img src=\"images/hageman-pat.png\"><br></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: BlinkMacSystemFont, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, &quot;Droid Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">In my early days of genealogy research I was researching my 3rd great-grandfather Jeremiah Dixon.

However, I am no longer using that platform actively. The good news about sites like WikiTree is that you get to collaborate with other researchers. The bad news is that other researchers can edit your family members in ways that don’t match your vision for how said family member might be represented. They can also add people that don’t exist, either through ignorance or a glitch in the import process. Site guidelines may dictate that these non-existent people are left in place, with internal notes explaining the problem, since some future person might also try to add them. In other words, things get messy and you have no control over them.</p>\n<p>I have generally abandoned any idea of a Family Association.

It has connected me to other Dixon genealogists more than any other source.

I refuse to believe that I’m the only Dixon descendant doing so, yet sometimes it feels that way. Queries and pieces of information scattered throughout the world. Somewhere — in some dusty attic in Indiana, or some library shelf or storage room in Delaware, or some computer database in Scotland not connected to the internet, or some Parish register in Ireland in some basement — are the details of my ancestors. I know they are there, I just can’t get to them! And what is worse is that some of their owners don’t seem to care.</p>\n<p>I can’t necessarily do anything about that, but I can do something about my fellow Dixon researchers. Many of them have run into brick walls and dead ends. All they know is a name, maybe a death date, maybe a city and state. Beyond that it is all black. Now, again I can’t necessarily do anything about that for most researchers, but for Dixon researchers I am determined to help! And my desire is also somewhat selfish as I intend to help myself. I want us to all connect and pool our data, our information, our contacts. And I have been wanting to do this for a long time and have, for some reason, kept putting it off. I obsess over the details and leave the shovel leaning against the shed. But no more, I hereby announce the following:</p>\n<p>I am hereby starting the Dixon Family Association</p>\n<p>I envision this entity to eventually include all descendants of not only Henry Dixon (b. 1633) but the descendants of one Thomas Dicson born some time in the 13th century.

I had developed an interest in early buildings in the area about 1981 and had moved the first building, the Huckaby log cabin, to this site in 1983. In 1984, a fellow employee at Weyerhaeuser, Moncure, told me about this house in the country south of Siler City. He had been given some wide boards from the house, had taken pictures, and brought me some nails from the boards. I knew the house looked early, earlier than the cut nails from the interior paneling boards indicated.</p>\n<p>It was some time before I got to visit the house. With its massive fireplace, exposed beams, and trim remnants I knew we were on to something special, but I had no idea of just what I was looking at. Research into the architectural style and the location yielded several interesting facts.\nThe style was Pennsylvania German. The interior fireplace, rat-tail strap hinges, finely crafted doors, and attic constructions were features not present on English and Scottish styled housed in the region. The house sat in the heart of what was a thriving Quaker settlement in the late 18th century. The community, know as Napton, was centered just north of the present community of Mt. Vernon Springs. The old cemetery and a foundation for an early school were located about one half mile east of the house. A springhouse had once stood just south of the dwelling, and the remains of a rock dam, probably for a gristmill, is also on the property just south of the house.</p>\n<p>The house had never been wired or plumbed, and was in a sad state of disrepair when I first looked at it. The first floor timbers and flooring had collapsed into a rock-lined cellar; sheets of tin had blown off the roof some years before, and all the window sash had been destroyed. Rot and insects were taking their toll; the house was home to a hive of honeybees and a nest of hornets. Termites had long since left the riddled shells of massive sills and framing timbers.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I knew the house was interesting and went off searching for information about its past. As it turned out, the records concerning the property predated the formation of Chatham County. The trail led to Orange County, from which Chatham was formed in 1771. Surprisingly, both early will and deed records existed regarding the property. The house sat on a portion of a rectangular shaped 520-acre grant issued in 1756 to a man named John May. He sold the northwest portion of the grant to his son in 1758, but ended up taking in back. He resold the parcel to <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1123\">Joseph Dixon</a> in 1766, but the deed was not recorded until 1768. (Joseph was an uncle of <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-355\">Simon Dixon</a>, who moved from Pennsylvania to the Snow Camp area of Guilford County in 1751.)\nNOTE: Joseph and Simon were cousins, sharing the grandfather <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-357\">William</a>, the immigrant</p>\n<p>Joseph authored a will in late 1769 that was probated in early 1770 in which he left this tract to son, <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1124\">Jesse Dixon</a>. (This was not his “home” tract, which he left to wife, <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Pusey-10\">Mary</a>.) These people were Quakers, and Napton remained a part of the Cane Creek Meeting in the Snow Camp Area. Jesse was disowned in 1773 for marrying “out of union” to a non-Quaker. Her name was <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Winters-236\">Lydia Winters</a>, and by the 1790 U.S. census, she had borne 7 of their 9 children. Jesse and family joined the slow migration of neighbors moving to the “free lands” opening up in the upper Midwest, and they moved to Ross County, Ohio in 1803.</p>\n<blockquote>On 10 Jun 1769, John MAY, Sr. &amp; Mary, his wife, of Orange County, North Carolina, sold to Joseph DIXON, 80 acres on Tick Creek, adjacent George DIXON.</blockquote>\nThis deed was prefaced by \"Whereas John MAY by virtue of an indenture executed by John MAY, Sr. dated 11 Apr 1766 became owner of a tract in Orange containing 100 acres conveyed to John MAY, Jr. by John MAY, Sr. by deed dated 16 Aug 1760 which tract is part of 520 acres from Granville to John MAY, Sr. 13 Feb 1756, Now this indenture.\" - signed: John <u>JM</u> MAY, Mary <u>X</u> MAY, witnessed by Jacob BROOKS, Caleb DIXON, William GREAVES, proved by BROOKS Jul Term 1769.\n<p>The house was certainly built during this 33 year period of ownership by <a href=\"https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dixon-1124\">Jesse Dixon</a>, but there is no evidence as to just when. The architectural evidence of pure Pennsylvania styling and possible imported items from there, like the “rat-tail” hinges, and the circumstantial evidence, like his marrying in 1772 or ’73, hint of an early build date in the 1770’s. On the other hand, the scale of the house suggests the means of an established man, and it could have been a second residence built in the 1780’s or ‘90s.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, Jesse’s brother-in-law NOTE: his cousin's son - Simon's father, Thomas, married Phoebe Dixon, another grandchild of William Dixon, Simon Rubottom, consummated the deed for the property in 1808, although he may have lived in the house from the time Jesse had left some 5 years before. Simon stayed until 1815 when his wife and 14 children joined the migration into the upper Midwest. In that year Rubottom transferred the property to his brother-in-law, Samuel Dowd. A diary exists in which a member of the wagon train that made the trek to Ohio chronicled the journey. The trip began 2 weeks after Rubottom sold the property to Dowd and took 6 weeks to finish.</p>\n<p>Samuel Dowd was a son of Conner Dowd, who had risen to local prominence as a fierce loyalist during the Revolutionary War in the Carbonton area of what is not Lee County. Samuel married Hannah Rubottom and raised a large family in the house. Architectural evidence suggest tat he, shortly after buying the property, probably added the one story rear shed rooms with adjoining kitchen wing, and the one story front porch.</p>\n<p>Note: An interesting sideline for me has been the fact that I discovered that Sam Dowd is an ancestor of mine on my mother’s side, so the man who bought the house in 1815 was my great-great-great-great- grandfather.\nSamuel Dowd died in 1853 and left the house and land to his youngest son, Horace Quincy Dowd. Horace was a hat maker and shows up repeatedly in Branson’s Business Directory in the latter 1800’s. The property stayed in the Dowd family until 1935, but the Moore family, the last related members living in the house, had moved to Mebane about 1920. Mrs. Leda Moore Taylor, who still resides in Mebane, was born in the house in 1910.\nThe Bruton family bought the property in 1935, and his daughter and her husband, Willis Wrenn, remain the current owners. After visiting the house several times in 1984, I approached Willis Wrenn about buying the house. My intent was to dismantle the house and reconstruct it in Harnett County. Restoring the house at the original site was out of the question; it was about a mile off the road in a pasture at the end of an often-muddy road. Termites had destroyed the lower timbers of the house, and the chimney was so decayed that it could be moved with one hand. The Wrenns were at first reluctant to sell, but they knew the house was only going to rot down if left alone. I committed to put the house back up and not part it out of the beams and boards.</p>\n<p>The reasons that I could commit to taking the house down were twofold. First of all, I was working shift work at Weyerhaeuser with a friend, Greg Talbott. Greg shared my interest in old buildings and enjoyed a challenge as much as I did. His advantages were that he was a lot bigger and stronger than I was, and he wasn’t afraid of heights. Secondly, my dad and brother were farmers, so they owned the trucks, trailers, and tractors that could help take the timbers down and haul them to Harnett County, With Greg’s commitment and help, and my pilfering equipment every other week, we had the house down in less than six months. It was a lot of hard dirty work, but it was one of the most satisfying times in my life.</p>\n<p>After moving and storing several truckloads of good to not-so-good timbers and lumber, over 5,000 brick, and thousands of pounds of rock, the project sat dormant for years. I didn’t really get back in reconstructing the house until the spring of 1994. The next year was spent laying the stone foundation and installing the sills, floor joists, and subfloor. After repairing many of the main timbers, and recutting many more, we erected the six main posts and the six-second floor plates in September of 1995. I had envisioned hundreds of times how this could be accomplished, but there’s always that bit of doubt regarding such a new and risky venture. It was even more risky considering the whole crew of family and friends that did it had no construction experience, and we did it with a farm tractor and a homemade boom. Amazingly, it went according to plan, and no one got hurt.\nThat was an emotional day for me. I sat out in front of the site until dark staring at those posts standing 20’ in the air and thought to myself, “This project is a GO! We’re going to finally make it happen after 10 years of waiting.” The rest has been no less satisfying, and, given continued health and well-being, it will be finished.</p>\n<h3>Architectural Features</h3>\n<p>The most striking single feature of the Dixon-Dowd house is its scale; it was a large house in central North Carolina when it was built. The second most noticeable feature is the overall quality of construction; it is a finely crafted house that was meticulously fitted together. Immigrants brought both characteristics from Pennsylvania. The Dixons were not German, but they had been exposed to their tradition in that colony of building full two story housed with massive post and beam construction. Most houses in the “wilderness” of North Carolina were simple one or two room houses with an attic. “Story and one Half” construction was prevalent among English and Scottish settlers, and log construction was probably more common than framed structures.</p>\n<p>Other details evident in the house suggest Pennsylvania building traditions. The house had a cellar with finely crafted stone foundation. A wind vent, or vertical slit, was located in the eastern end of the foundation; this feature is often seen in the walls of massive stone barns that still exist in Pennsylvania. (I did not reproduce the vent in the new foundation.) The wooden grill in the front foundation wall is a reproduction of the original. These were common on houses of this period built in North Carolina.\nA springhouse had been located just south of the dwelling at its original site. The foundation still exists. The building was approximately 12’ x 14’, and had steps at one end leading down to the spring that the building once covered. Other springhouses were said to have existed in the Napton area, and they were commonly constructed in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>The floor plan of the house follows the directions suggested by William Penn in the early days of the colony; that is to build a house “with two thirds at one end forming the hall and the other end divided into two smaller rooms for sleeping.” This three-room plan is repeated on the second floor.\nThe large fireplace in the hall once served as the center for cooking for the household. The fireplace opening is 7 feet across. A wooden pole was mounted crosswise in the chimney opening from which irons for pots were hung; a cooking crane was probably once mounted on the other side of the firebox wall. Normally, the main fire would have burned in the center of the fireplace, and hot coals would have been dragged to either side for heating pots and pans.</p>\n<p>A 12” square oak beam serves as the lintel, or support for the brickwork above the fireplace opening. This is the only oak used in the house; the rest of the wood is pine. Iron was a scarce commodity in colonial times, and it was not available in a big enough piece to support the brickwork; hence, the oak support.</p>\n<p>The brick for the fireplace were probably produced locally. The opening for the firebox, as well as the exposed brick on the second floor and the attic came from the original chimney. Notice that the ends of the brick forming the corners of the firebox were made with a bevel so that they fitted evenly when laid with a taper to the back of the fireplace.</p>\n<p>Most of the timbers for the house were sawed on a “sash saw,” or water powered saw with reciprocating straight saw blades. The even, straight saw marks are evident on all timbers of the house except for the two upper plates in the side-walls and the two purloins n the attic. These four timbers run full 32’6” length of the house and were hewn. Undoubtedly, the saw carriage at the mill could not handle timbers this long.</p>\n<p>The support timbers in the attic are known as a “principal rafter support” system. I do not know of the existence of another house in North Carolina built with this system. The feature is so named because a pair of principal, or heavy rafters, are installed two thirds of the distance from the chimney end of the house and over the interior wall, which has a load bearing support post. These principal rafters in turn support purloins which are tenoned into the end rafters and act as supports for the remaining interior rafters. This has the advantage of leaving the attic open for head space because cross braces, or “ wind beams” for the rafters are not needed.\nThe doors for the front and back are original. Notice the quality of their construction. The strap hinges for the back door are original; the finely tapered, wavy ends are known as “serpentine” or “rat tail” tips. These are definitely Pennsylvania German and may have been made there. The hinges on the front door are copies, as is the door latch, but they match the “ghost prints” of these items that were on the door. Jerry Darnel, well-known black smith from the Jugtown area, made them.</p>\n<p>The red paint on the front door is the oldest paint found on the house, and traces of this color were also found on the window casements. We have matched this color as closely as possible with new paint we used on the entire exterior. The back door was repainted in Spanish brown, another popular color in colonial times. The Georgian mantel for the shed room fireplace, which was added about 1815, was also done in this color.</p>\n<p>What I have wanted to convey is that the house is an early example for Central North Carolina, that it is a pure architectural style, that it is a wonderful statement of the abilities and teamwork of the people who built it, and that it has become a labor of love trying to put it back the way it was. It is repeating, for me, the aspect of teamwork, for the project had created friends and brought friends together for this, the second constructions. </p>\n<p>Thank you so very much.</p>","H":"-f=gO6Ai9","G":1662833690452},{"C":"Sa9L@~@G|","A":"Nathan Dixon Spring House","D":"nathan_dixon_spring_house","E":1662833763436,"F":"<p><img width=\"500\" src=\"images/Dixon-Nathan_springhouse-3.jpg\"></p>\n<p><i>Nathan Dixon spring house</i></p>\n<p></p><hr><p></p>\n<blockquote>💡 Originally written by Edwin Patterson - reproduced here since the original site has gone offline.
